## About me

You can definitely tell that there is a developer at my house. Using open software and a Raspberry-pi I am making all of my IOT devices talk to each other. An example of one of this automation, when I leave home on a rainy day I will get a reminder to take an umbrella with me.

When I finished my bachelor degree I began working with Big Data problems and Technologies. I have familiarized myself with the paradigm, and I love it. Part of it has been looking into machine learning and exploring the possibilities that come with it. I have worked mainly in classification text tasks, but I am understand the usual data wrangling techniques.

I am looking forward to working and learning from people who are also passionate about Big Data and ML.

## Professional experience

### Data Engineer & Data Scientist @ [Rebold](https://letsrebold.com/)
Jul 2016 - Present

I work as a data engineer. Although, sometimes, I have to look at the data. My main tools are Python and Scala. I have worked with a bunch of different Big Data technologies, like Spark, Redis, NoSql DB, and others. I have also done some ML with Scikit-learn and SparkML that are used in production. Almost everything is deploy to AWS.

Acceso became Rebold by the merger with Digilant.

### Intern @ [Acceso](http://www.acceso.com/wp-signup.php?new=acceso.es)
Oct 2015 - Jun 2016

During my time at Acceso, as Intern, I developed th final project for my bachelor degree. It was an API for machine learning with Spark by using Java and Scala.

## Education

### Deep Learning Nanodegree @ [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)
2018

4 months program. It included building convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation and generative adversarial networks for image generation.

### Grado en Ingeniería Informática (Computer Science Bachelor) @ [Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha](https://www.uclm.es/)
